The abundance of information and videos available online can make getting started with Data Science/Machine Learning very challenging. However, by using the right tools, you can easily acquire the necessary skills.

The PLMP rule is what I call it in my recommendation!

Using the materials sequentially is a good way to get started;

P - Python: Python for everyone -- https://www.coursera.org/learn/python 

L - Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
Pandas - Datacamp course on Pandas --- https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas
Numpy - Datacamp course on Numpy ---  https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-numpy
Matplotlib - Datacamp course on Matplotlib -- https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/matplotlib-tutorial-python

M - Machine learning course ----- https://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python
